# Miscellaneous
Just random scripts that don't require an entire repo for themselves. Probably wouldn't be much use to anyone else.

## VBA
**setup_files_from_templates.vba**

Small workflow script for a friend. It's probably pretty sloppy; I didn't know vba when I started it and only put a few hours into it. It was intended to handle the repetitive task of:
  - Create a file name from 2 cells of a row in an excel document
  - Create a directory with that name
  - Open a template file
  - Add the values from the cells into the template
  - Save the template with the same name created above, into the directory created above
  - repeat for X number of rows


 When run, the script will:
  - Ask which row to start on
  - Ask for an output location
  - Ask for the template file
